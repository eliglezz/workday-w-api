# workday-w-api
This was another homework assignment, the idea was to use moment.js to display time on top and have the page change the inputs change color depending on the time of day. We also had to be able to enter task/todos in local storage and recall the value and display it in the input box. The css and index was provided. Bootstrap was also used. I had a few issues that where I had the logic figured out but didn't quite know the methods to use with jquery. I'm especially for my tutor cause they helped me figure out the methods and showed me how to use the .each method.
